# Gentry-fication
A project looking at the relationship between aristocratic names and the street names of the United Kingdom.

![A shot of central London with all the roads whose names have links to aristocrats highlighted in yellow](https://github.com/siskiyoucedar/Gentry-fication/assets/124599703/68675357-9695-48a2-a18b-83461c13707b)

"_ew, that img looks gross!_"

**I know. The viz for this project is still WIP**

## Input Data

To use this code you will need:

The open access Ordnance Survey geometry for all the roads in the country:

(this is... er... hopefully... included in the repo via LFS)

Trying to run commands on 400,000 datapoints is proving a dead bother, so I'm not going to do it. Instead:

## Current to-do
- Filter to Greater London (work by borough) before joining names-data
- Produce stats on % aristocratic names in each LB
- Build out hypotheses: one would expect higher % across inner London with particular hotspots in Westminster, Kensington for obvious reasons
- Continue reading. Victorian studies is litty as hell!
